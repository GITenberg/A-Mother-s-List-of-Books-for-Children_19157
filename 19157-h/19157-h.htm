<h2><i>Preface</i> <span class="pagenum">(p. ix)</span></h2>


<p>This little book, a revision of one privately printed a few years ago,
has been prepared for home use, and for this reason the classification
has been made according to the age, and not the school grade, of the
child. But as children differ so greatly in capacity, it should be
understood that in this respect the arrangement is only approximate.
The endeavor has been made to choose those fairy tales which are most
free from horrible happenings, and to omit all writings which tolerate
unkindness to animals. Humorous books are designated by a star and the
few sad ones by a circle.</p>

<p>The prices given are the same as those in the publishers' catalogues;
booksellers' prices are often less.</p>

<p>My thanks are extended to those publishers who have time and again
courteously provided the facilities for the examination of their
publications.</p>

<p>Miss Annie Carroll Moore, of the New York Public Library, was kind
enough to read for me the notes and comments. I wish most gratefully
to acknowledge the generous assistance given me by Miss Hewins, of
the Hartford Public Library, Miss Hunt, of the Brooklyn Public
Library, and Miss Jordan, of the Boston Public Library, who examined
the List, and suggested some changes and a few additions. Their
approbation is elsewhere expressed.</p>

<h2><i>A Mother's List</i> <span class="pagenum">(p. xi)</span></h2>


<p>It is said, in that earliest collection of English proverbs which was
made by John Heywood, more than three hundred years ago, that
"Children must learn to creep before they can go." This little book
for which I am asked to write a brief preface is, so far as I can find
out, the first consistent effort yet made towards teaching children to
read on John Heywood's principle. It is safe to say that it is
destined to carry light and joy into multitudes of households. It is
based upon methods such as I vaguely sighed after, nearly fifty years
ago, when I was writing in the <i>North American Review</i> for January,
1866, a paper entitled Children's Books of the Year. The essay was
written by request of Professor Charles Eliot Norton, then the editor
of that periodical, and I can now see how immensely I should have been
relieved by a book just like this Mother's List, a device such as
nobody in that day had the wisdom and faithful industry to put
together.</p>

<p>In glancing over the books discussed in that early paper of mine, it
is curious to see how the very titles of some of the most prominent
have now disappeared from sight. Where are the Little Prudy books
which once headed the list? Where are the stories of Oliver Optic?
Where is Jacob Abbott's John Gay; or Work for Boys? Even Paul and
Virginia have vanished, taking with them the philosophic Rasselas and
even the pretty story of Undine. Nothing of that list of thirty titles
is now well remembered except Cooper's Leatherstocking and Jane
Andrews's Seven Little Sisters Who Live on the Round Ball That Floats
in the Air, a book which has been translated into the languages of
remote nations of the globe, I myself having seen the Chinese and
Japanese versions. Thus irregular is the award of time and we must
accept it. Meanwhile this new book is organized on a better plan than
any dreamed of at that former period, the books being arranged not
merely by classes alone, but according to the age of the proposed
readers and stretching in regular order from two years old until
fourteen. The whole number of books being very large, there is no
overdue limitation, and this forms the simple but magical method of
reaching every variety of childish mind.</p>

<p>Thus excellent have been the changes: yet it is curious to observe on
closer study that the two classes of books which represent the two
extremes among the childish readers--Mother Hubbard and
Shakespeare--may still be said to be the opposite poles between which
the whole world of juvenile literature hangs suspended. A child needs
to be supplied with a proper diet of fancy as well as of fact; and of
fact as well as fancy. He is usually so constituted that if he were to
find a fairy every morning in his bread and milk at breakfast, it
would not very much surprise him; while yet his appetite for the
substantial food remains the same. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
seem nowhere very strange to him, while Chaucer and Spenser need only
to be simply told, while Dana's Two Years Before the Mast and Hughes's
Tom Brown's School Days at Rugby hold their own as well as Jack and
the Bean-Stalk. Grown up people have their prejudices, but children
have few or none. A pound of feathers and a pound of lead will usually
be found to weigh the same in their scales. Nay, we, their
grandparents, know by experience that there may be early cadences in
their ears which may last all their lives. For instance, Caroline
Fry's Listener would now scarcely find a reader in any group of
children, yet there is one passage in the book--one which forms the
close of some beggar's story about "Never more beholding Margaret
Somebody and her sunburnt child"--which would probably bring tears to
the present writer's eyes today, although he has not seen the book
since he was ten years of age.</p>

<p>It may be that every mature reader will miss from the list some book
or books of that precious childish literature which once throve and
flourished behind school desks. They were books founded partly on
famous history, as that of Baron Trenck and his escapes from prison,
Rinaldo Rinaldini, and The Three Spaniards. I am told that children do
not now find them in a pedlar's pack as we once found them,
accompanied by buns and peddled like them at recess time. Even if we
should find them both in such a place, they might have no such flavor
for us now. It is something if the flowers of American gossip are
retained in similar stories, even if their atmosphere is retreating
from all the hills. It is enough to know that we have for all our
children the works of Louisa Alcott and Susan Coolidge; that they
have Aldrich's Story of a Bad Boy and Mrs. Dodge's Hans Brinker and
Miss Hale's Peterkin Papers and The William Henry Letters by Mrs.
Diaz. We need not complain so long as our children can look
inexhaustively across the ocean for Andrew Lang's latest fairy-book
and Grimm's Household Stories as introduced to a new immortality by
John Ruskin.</p>

<p>I think your selections very carefully made and well adapted to
children who have books at home and mothers who read them.... With
many congratulations on the excellence of your book, both in form and
substance, believe me yours sincerely,</p>

<p>You do not owe me any thanks for my little assistance, for you have
given me quite as much as I have given you. It is more stimulating
than you can believe to discuss the subject with one whose point of
view is not that of the librarian. You must not call yourself an
amateur, however, for you are an expert on children's books. I have
gained a great many ideas from you, and have enjoyed comparing notes
with you immensely.<br>

             <span class="quotemi">Sincerely yours,</span></p>

<p>I am sending back your book with my notes and suggestions. It is an
uncommonly good list, however, and there is little that I have wished
to add or to take away.... Your list is so good that I know you must
have spent a great deal of time and very definite thought over it. You
have certainly covered the ground thoroughly.... I have enjoyed seeing
your list and shall be greatly interested in seeing it in final form.<br>

Caldecott was a fine literary artist, who was able to express himself
with rare facility in pictures in place of words, so that his comments
upon a simple text reveal endless subtleties of thought.... You have
but to turn to any of his toy-books to see that at times each word,
almost each syllable, inspired its own picture.... He studied his
subject as no one else ever studied it.... Then he portrayed it simply
and with inimitable vigor, with a fine economy of line and colour;
when colour is added, it is mainly as a gay convention, and not
closely imitative of nature.

mystery and Oriental cunning from every page, and should be given to
our youngsters only after examination, as a highly-strung child might

Children seem to possess an inherent conviction that when the hole is
big enough for the cat, no smaller one at the side is needed for the
kitten. They don't really care for "Glimpses" of this, or "Gleanings"
of that, or "Footsteps" to the other--but would rather stretch and
pull, and get on tiptoe to reach the sweeter fruit above them, than
confine themselves to the crabs which grow to their level.

<p>It is a good thing for children to learn from these quaint verses,

So, in this matter of literature for the young, the influence of the
home teaching is enormous; all the school can do pales before it. Let
the mother add to the poet's rhyme the music of her soft and beloved
voice; let great fiction be read to the breathless group of curly
heads about the fire; and the wonders of science be enrolled, the
thrilling scenes and splendid personalities of history displayed.

The tales contained in this volume have been the delight of many
generations of children, and can, in fact, claim a very distant
origin, though they were retold in their present form as late as the
age of Louis XIV. They are generally supposed to have come from the
East, for they are to be found in varied forms in all the countries of
Europe that sent forth Crusaders.... As children always like stories
to be retold in the same words as far as possible, these tales have
not been rewritten (except in two cases); the original translations in
their quaint simplicity have been collected, and merely corrected so
far as to meet the modern ideas of the kind of tale to be given to
children; the old ones being occasionally a little coarse.--<i>Preface</i>.

In Europe they were not known till 1704, when a learned Frenchman,
Antoine Galland, who had travelled widely in the East, put them
skillfully, if not too accurately, into the language of his own
people.... Within a comparatively few years, an ancient manuscript in
the Louvre at Paris has been found to remove from Galland the
long-standing reproach that he introduced into his Arabian Nights
stories which really did not belong to the collection, but were taken
from other Eastern sources.... It will not be easy to change the form

describe the eminent characters and remarkable events of our annals in

adventures of a chair, he has endeavored to keep a distinct and

sometimes assumed the license of filling up the outline of history
with details for which he has none but imaginative authority, but
which, he hopes, do not violate nor give a false coloring to the

The following Tales are meant to be submitted to the young reader as
an introduction to the study of Shakspeare, for which purpose his
words are used whenever it seemed possible to bring them in; ... words

possible avoided.... What these Tales shall have been to the <i>young</i>
readers, that and much more it is the writers' wish that the true
Plays of Shakspeare may prove to them in older years--enrichers of the
fancy, strengtheners of virtue, a withdrawing from all selfish and
mercenary thoughts, a lesson of all sweet and honourable thoughts and
actions, to teach courtesy, benignity, generosity, humanity: for of

<p>To Dan and Una, sitting, on Midsummer's Eve, in the old fairy ring,
appears Puck. By his magic power on this and succeeding visits
incidents based on events in Old England's history are told to the
children by those who shared in them. A series of remarkable stories,
alternating with even more remarkable poems. The average child will
better enjoy hearing them read aloud, as <span class="pagenum">(p. 182)</span>
they presuppose a
fuller knowledge of English history than most American children are
likely to possess. Mr. Rackham's pictures in color are fine work.</p>

Shakespeare appears to have derived his materials was Sir Thomas

Macbeth was first printed in the folio of 1623.... It was written
between 1604 and 1610.... Dr. Simon Forman ... saw the play performed
"at the Globe, 1610, the 20th of April, Saturday." It may then have
been a new play, but it is more probable, as nearly all the critics
agree, that it was written in 1605 or 1606. The accession of James
made Scottish subjects popular in England, and the tale of Macbeth and
Banquo would be one of the first to be brought forward, as Banquo was
held to be an ancestor of the new king. Shakespeare drew the materials
for the plot of Macbeth from Holinshed's Chronicles of Englande,
Scotlande, and Ireland.... The story of the drama is almost wholly
apocryphal. The more authentic history is thus summarized by Sir
Walter Scott: ... As a king, the tyrant so much exclaimed against was,
in reality, a firm, just, and equitable prince.--<i>Introduction</i>.

<p>This book comprises sixteen examples of fifteenth-century work, with
an introduction, also containing other information, on some
characteristics of Tuscan sculpture of this period.</p>

<div class="quotega">
The Italian sculptors of the earlier half of the fifteenth century are
more than mere forerunners of the great masters of its close, and
often reach perfection within the narrow limits which they chose to
impose on their work. Their sculpture shares with the paintings of
Botticelli and the churches of Brunelleschi that profound
expressiveness, that intimate impress of an indwelling soul, which is
the peculiar fascination of the art of Italy in that century.

It has always seemed to me that the narratives of the early
discoverers and explorers of the American coast were as interesting as
Robinson Crusoe, and were, indeed, very much like it. This has led me
to make a series of extracts from these narratives, selecting what
appeared to me the most interesting parts, and altering only the
spelling.... One great thing which I have wished my readers to learn
is the charm of an original narrative.... The explorers of various
nations are represented in this book. There are Northmen, Italians,
Englishmen, Frenchmen, Spaniards, and Dutchmen.--<i>Preface</i>.

The ancient manners, the habits and customs of the aboriginal race by
whom the Highlands of Scotland were inhabited, had always appeared to
me peculiarly adapted to poetry. The change in their manners, too, had
taken place almost within my own time, or at least I had learned many
particulars concerning the ancient state of the Highlands from the old
men of the last generation. I had always thought the old Scottish Gael
highly adapted for poetical composition.... I had also read a great
deal, seen much, and heard more, of that romantic country where I was
in the habit of spending <span class="pagenum">(p. 214)</span>
some time every Autumn; and the
scenery of Loch Katrine was connected with the recollection of many a
dear friend and merry expedition of former days. This poem, the action
of which lay among scenes so beautiful and so deeply imprinted on my
recollections, was a labor of love, and it was no less so to recall
the manners and incidents introduced. The frequent custom of James IV,
and particularly of James V, to walk through their kingdom in
disguise, afforded me the hint of an incident which never fails to be
interesting if managed with the slightest address or
dexterity.--<i>Introduction to the Edition of 1830</i>.

"The reader, if he has perused the volume of the Sketch Book, will
probably recollect something of the Bracebridge family, with which I
once passed a Christmas. I am now on another visit at the Hall, having
been invited to a wedding which is shortly to take place.... The
family mansion is an old manor-house, standing in a retired and
beautiful part of Yorkshire. Its inhabitants have been always regarded
through the surrounding country as 'the great ones of the earth,' and
the little village near the hall looks up to the squire with almost
feudal homage.... While sojourning in this stronghold of old fashions,
it is my intention to make occasional sketches of the scenes and
characters before me."<br><br>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
